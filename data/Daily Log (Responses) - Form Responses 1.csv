The stress of trying to dance with a girl is just not worth it. Maybe you get lucky and it's cool but I just can't see the reason to put in the work. Gonna take Brian to the house and head to CS building to work. Have a good night man. :),1/26/2019,1
1/27/2019 22:06:42,3,7,7,8,Back to the grind. Got a good amount of stuff done today. I have things planned out decently well for this week. Gotta make sure I keep planning to stay ahead. Definitely will work on that this week. Not too much to report today. Sleep tight.,1/27/2019,1

1/29/2019 21:49:49,2,7,7,7,Got a good amount done. Not too much left on the lists for this week. Gives me a lot of time to get ahead. Might try working out on TuTh now doing just core and back work. ,1/29/2019,1
1/30/2019 20:47:57,2,8,7,7,On top of work and it feels dope. Preparing to work hard on Saturday so I can stay ahead and watch the Superbowl on Sunday.

But not going to get ahead of myself.,2/4/2019,2
2/5/2019 22:30:27,4,7,8,7,Got a lot of work done. Group theory proofs are very satisfying. Watching chopped on our TV haha. Trying to juggle hoop band this week will be tough but I'm mostly done with hw. Looking forward to investigating the permeable pavers idea more.,2/5/2019,2

I'm going to start taking more notes to get ahead soon. Also studying for the Spanish quiz tomorrow. But first, some CS:GO.",2/6/2019,2
2/7/2019 22:41:05,2,7,7,7,Handed in 411 hw. Got more assignments from classes. Hoop band was alright. I think I figured why I don't like guitar anymore. People only telling you you're good at something really fucks up ability to improve. I just very got real feedback and I felt that being good was a requirement and I had to be immediately good at everything. Definitely not healthy. Oh well.,2/7/2019,1
2/8/2019 20:27:32,2,8,7,7,Chill Friday. We got halal cart!!!!! He's back cos it's nice out. Holy fuck tho. I cannot believe Sam broke up with Brian. This pretty much changes everything. Next week will be different from the last 20. ,2/8/2019,2

2/11/2019 21:41:17,4,6,6,7,"Rip this weekend. A little bit more behind in work than I would like. Nothing I can't manage but I'm gonna have to put in the time to stay reasonably ahead. Also everyone seemed to be looking at me in Worcester. Super uncomfortable and I start to have a stress response. I need a better coping mechanism other than blasting Such Gold. Perhaps breathing exercises? Oh well, go get em fam. Jeep up the positivity and you got this!",2/11/2019,1
2/12/2019 23:16:22,3,7,7,7,Catching up more. Math HW is getting a lot tougher. Definitely utilizing office hours a lot more this year which I see as a good thing. Excited to run again tomorrow.

2/14/2019 5:59:21,3,7,8,7,Got a lot done today. Going to office hours is helpfuling quite a bit. The snow made things pretty interesting today.

2/16/2019 7:42:40,3,8,7,6,"Nice chill Friday. Ended up getting all my work done so I spent the day doing light work and chilling. It was also nice to hear out and get food by myself.

Oh well, getting super baked is lit and I'm looking forward to putting in some hard work tomorrow.",2/15/2019,1

2/18/2019 8:07:55,3,7,7,7,"Got some good with done today. Felt good to have asked back. Squad really isn't the same without him. Duck economics. The fact he can't afford to come here is ridiculous. Anyway, gotta work hard tomorrow too but nothing we can't do.",2/17/2019,1
2/19/2019 6:06:42,2,8,7,7,Getting mega fucked with some of the boys. It's good to have Alex back. Also I'm getting to impart a bunch of my music knowledge on peeps.,2/17/2019,1

2/19/2019 23:14:28,3,8,8,7,Killing on homework right now. Hopefully the grades are good too haha. Keep the self love going fam. Perhaps soon we might venture to ask someone out but idk. Doesn't seem worth it considering my situation for the next few years. I would honestly just like to go on dates.,2/19/2019,2
2/21/2019 5:50:48,2,7,6,7,"Was actually kind of sore from the gym today. Gonna attempt to go in the morning on Thursday. Also I need to remember to do these on time like damn. This week has been mad chill. I'm hoping I can finish the Spanish HW tomorrow so that I just have 411 to work on starting the weekend. I'm started to put in some work to start midterm studying and I think it's gonna be tough but doable. Anyway, catching some z's.",2/20/2019,3
2/21/2019 22:24:19,2,8,8,8,Got lots done. Finished for this week. Only pending deadline is 411 due next Thursday. I'm chilling fam. Def tryna die on the weekends. Let's obtain this wheat,2/21/2019,2

2/24/2019 20:50:17,3,6,5,6,Didn't get too much done. Tried to catch up on sleep. Stats still not posted so I haven't missed anything there. Alcohol that we got was terrible and I'm not trusting like that ever again. Let's get some hardcore midterm studying done this week.,2/24/2019,1
2/26/2019 5:49:37,3,6,6,7,Got more done today. Got a bit worn out at the end of the day tho. Not sure what happened but I think it had to do with masturbation and the caffeine I had. Oh well. Gotta finish that Spanish tomorrow before class.,2/25/2019,2
2/26/2019 22:42:03,3,7,7,7,"Still trudging through the work. Will hopefully have stats done midday tomorrow which will give me time to catch up on the notes I'm behind on. Then Thursday will be the true start to my studying. That gives me a good week before the first exam so I'm not too worried. Funny how my thoughts always dwell on my race and position in society. I'm not entirely sure why I have so much of this anxiety but I definitely need a professional opinion. Based on how much it affects me, it must be related to something else. Anyway",2/26/2019,3
2/27/2019 22:38:37,3,8,7,8,Had a pretty good time today. I got a lot of work done and then started to study. Not too eventful. I think people are going at it upstairs lmao.,2/27/2019,2
2/28/2019 21:19:18,2,8,6,8,It's been a pretty chill week. It's seems weird because I have exams but I'm way less stressed than I've ever been. But this is not too much of me lying to myself because I am spending time to prepare. I did three practice exams for 411 already and I'm understanding the content in class well. I'll definitely have to put in work over the weekend but I'm not too worried. Just gotta make sure I don't have too much fun. ,2/28/2019,1
3/2/2019 11:31:46,2,7,7,7,"Pretty chill day. Made some progress on the Spanish project but honestly not that much. Chilling tonight with the dudes and then basketball later. Holy shit tho. Went to this Mexican/El Salvadorian place and I died. Such good food. Mad cheap. Filling af. I really miss being imursed in Latino culture. It was cool to be in Argentina and be totally unbridled to understand, feel, respect, empathize, and have fun with people in their natural environment. Humanity in general as well as the humanity of individuals and their communities is an expression of true beauty. ",3/1/2019,1
3/3/2019 13:09:27,4,6,7,6,Wow rip. I spent the morning putting in some work which was good but end of the day was pretty much a fucking mess. It was fun in general but rip shishir. I'm not sure how some people go so hard with partying. Thank God I got that Irish blood. I'm definitely going to have to use that advantage more in the future which I'm not sure excited for. Overall pretty fun day for me but not all. End of day was nice because Anthony's date was super cute and I love driving. I'm looking forward to heading back out to get some more things I forgot tomorrow. Anyway pheww,3/2/2019,1
3/3/2019 22:11:13,3,5,7,7,Got pretty worked up during the day. I just really didn't want to be around people I guess. I'm not sure what set it off but I was just becoming frustrated with listening to so much. Driving helped a lot. I'm glad I took that time for myself. It honestly might have been remnants of drinking during the day on Saturday but I'm not sure. I ended up getting a good amount done but I have a lot to do tomorrow. Let's get to bed and get this bread.,3/3/2019,1
3/4/2019 21:05:44,3,7,7,7,Getting more school stuff done. Tests still aren't looking too bad. Definitely need to study more but I'm not too worried.,3/4/2019,1
3/5/2019 22:29:09,4,7,7,7,Another not too eventful day. Tomorrow is D-DAY for 411 and I think I'm pretty much set. If it's bad then so be it but I know that I know the material and that is mostly what matters. Stats I'm a little worried about but I did the practice exam without notes so I'm not sure what I'm missing. Will consult with shishir tomorrow. 326 is also looking weird. Gonna be interesting to figure out the rest of this semester. Traveling will be amazing but I gotta make sure I put in mad work the week we get back so that I stay ahead. 589 I'm already behind in so I gotta put in some mega work. Definitely going to be doing a bit of studying in Paris or London so ya know.,3/5/2019,1
3/6/2019 21:06:23,2,8,8,8,"Fucking destroyed that 411 exam. Absolutely rekt. Turns out I studied enough. The uncertainty was relatively high but it worked out great. Alright, time to chill with Brian and eat wings.",3/6/2019,1
3/9/2019 23:04:49,2,6,6,6,Low stress about things to do but being back home is always a bit of a drag. Going to London tomorrow tho which will be lit.,3/9/2019,1

3/11/2019 17:10:12,3,7,6,7,"Holy moly I'm dead today. London is amazing but I am absolutely exhausted from not sleeping on the plane. We hit up Buckingham and the houses of Parliament but what do you know, Big Ben is getting renovated so the entire tower is obscured. Oh well, still chilling and living life.",3/11/2019,1
3/12/2019 20:19:36,3,8,8,8,"It was great. We did the British museum and the natural history museum, and then we walked the whole length of Hyde Park and went to an Indian place for dinner. Accidentally told Mukul about the wedding thinking he knew. This squad drama is fucking bullshit. Definitely going to end it when I get back. Slowly but steadily. Anyway, let's see what tomorrow has in store.",3/12/2019,1
3/14/2019 0:06:15,3,7,7,7,"More chilling rn. Did a lot today. Tower of London, Tower bridge, the Shard, British Transport Museum, and Leicester Square (I think it's called that). Fun to talk at a bar with a bro. I wish people were of age and actually had money. These experiences are great but our squad just can't have them. Sad but it's the way it's gotta be.",3/13/2019,1
3/14/2019 17:47:53,3,7,6,7,"Made it to Paris! Hit up the Louvre. Definitely need to go back while tripping. Shit was insane. Looking forward to this sleep because me legs are dead.

3/28/2019 9:05:56,3,8,7,6,Holy shit sweet microdose but lasted a bit too long.

I think I'm definitely done with partying super hard. At least here at UMass. Shit is pretty terrible. Over the summer it was pretty fun. I like when no one assumes who each other are and you can just party in the way you like. Not gonna lie, squad here has a very specific type of party they look for. Not sure what exactly it is but you know we would never sing Disney songs at a party that they liked. Maybe I felt at home there but others like sathvik didn't cos he wouldn't know those songs. But everyone was fukt up so idk. Aight piece I have to stop binging this thread.",3/31/2019,1
4/1/2019 20:35:46,3,7,6,7,Slept really terribly last night. Not sure what was going on. Couldn't go to the gym. Little bit disappointing but I was really sore from running on Sunday so maybe it's for the better. Got mad work still but I'm chipping away. If I can get mad stuff done now then I will be prepared to put in mad work to study for the exams next week. Man the weekend really fucked me up. Too much anxiety I needa take a break. Idk fam just think more and critically and maybe do something good again. Give back and keep working hard.,4/1/2019,1
4/2/2019 23:13:09,3,7,7,7,Got great progress on the 589 project. Getting less stressed as I'm chilling away at the HW I got. Definitely need to start studying for the exams soon tho. Schedule is all set which is nice. That girl in 326 who's also on my 411 actually said I was a reliable resource for 411 stuff so that's cool. Studying before the class has paid huge dividends. Really need to go to the gym tomorrow. I'm excited to get back into it. Let's hit it!,4/2/2019,1
4/3/2019 21:15:37,3,8,7,8,"Went to the gym, finished stats, almost finished 589, and restocked on gum. Definitely pretty fucking successful day. Chillin at CVS rn. Super weird tho that I took the thing about my voice being like Donald duck and Mickey mouse so personally. Didn't think it would matter to me but it does a little. Still go a lot of anxiety that Arushi likes me. Lots of stress but I'm still killing the work and getting big so no worries. Aight tryna smoke and hit the bed.",4/3/2019,1
4/5/2019 15:20:52,3,7,7,7,Pretty dank. Almost done all the work needed for this week. Hype to hit the gym in the morning. ,4/4/2019,1
4/6/2019 10:33:42,3,8,8,8,"Chill day. Got stuff turned in. Why to bbq with squad. Had a great convos with Brian. I definitely should just pull the trigger on therapy. For real, I'm a traveler and I'm not gonna get a good place where I feel ""ready"" to go to therapy so I just need to go. Imma try sometime this or next week. Got mad high with Brian and Matt. We watched Queer Eye which is so fucking wholesome and it makes me so happy. OMG I gotta watch it more. Anyway, imma catch some zzzs. ",4/5/2019,1
4/7/2019 13:07:05,3,8,8,8,"Wow super fucked up. Pretty sure we succeeded in giving mukul a good birthday bash. Didn't wanna go out but holy shit that man was enthusiastic I couldn't say no. First time I've tried to do something like this for someone. It was a bit stressful because you didn't know if it was gonna work but oh well. You try and that's what matters. Anyway, got mad shit to do but imma fucking do it.",4/6/2019,1
4/7/2019 22:07:16,4,6,5,6,"Fucking dead tired. Lots of work done but it's gonna be a long week. Two exams but I'm not too worried about either. Studying tomorrow. Anyway, I'm kinda grumpy. Mukuls birthday thing was great but man idk about Brian. Definitely not a good friend to mukul. Hurts a bit but I'm glad mukul had a good time. That's what matters to me. I want to address this whole situation but can't find a good time. Anyway ...

I'm also thinking I should really branch it this summer in Seattle. I need to have some weird sex. It's gotta be on the list along many other things. Alright definitely time to go to bed.",4/7/2019,1
4/9/2019 8:52:23,4,5,6,6,Fucking complete dead end on a CS project. No idea what is going wrong. Seems like numerical errors. Might try to fix it tomorrow but no guarantee. Dead tired. Gonna sleep.,4/8/2019,2
4/9/2019 21:34:54,2,7,6,7,"Fucking destroyed that 411 exam. Studying pretty chill. Wasn't worried and I preformed well. Honestly, the class has to not be that hard. I'm not sure how these peeps saying that other classes like combinatorics are harder cos I'm slammin on this class. Anyway, good execution all around. Also fixed the 589 project today and submitted the 326 phase 2 after recording the video. All around super day. Time management fucking dominating rn. Idk congrats dude and keep working hard.",4/9/2019,2
4/10/2019 23:07:17,3,7,5,6,"Really low motivation today. I think this semester is just dragging at this point. I'm kind of excited tho because as soon as I started to think about projects, I got hype. This is good because I need that motivation to get me to following thru and have something good to show at the end I'm not working for my future career so this is pretty important. I'm gonna go as hard as possible and hopefully get some results. Definitely logical to choose the news clusters because the wav to IPA would be insanely hard.",4/10/2019,2
4/12/2019 10:13:21,3,7,7,6,Studying. Bored. Tired. Test is a thing tomorrow. Trying to decide whether or not to go to Arushi's 21st. ,4/11/2019,1

You're on a lot of shit rn so you gotta use your head but I think you got it. Social shit might get a bit weird but just roll with it. Holy shit K-pop is so fucking dank. Watching Dalla Dalla rn just to date this post lmao. And it came out a while ago too haha. Anyway, good work boys. Get ready for the next round.",4/12/2019,1
4/13/2019 22:35:34,3,7,7,7,"Honestly pretty productive day. So nice to just chill. I think it's super fucking funny that I left my glasses. How could I remember my sweatshirt but not my glasses. Anyway, lots of progress on the trading project. Should get something working by tomorrow. ",4/13/2019,1
4/15/2019 8:50:37,3,7,7,7,"Doing aight. Legit worked on the trading algo all day lmao. Might work, might not. We'll see. Gotta do actual work tomorrow. Getting lunch with kliment which is nice but I just gotta also schedule around that. We watching Blade Runner rn but I don't think Brian likes the decision. Idk from now on imma just give him the benefit of the doubt. I can be patient so I will be while he works stuff out. Also, crazy high realization. Definitely part of the reason I avoid social situations is so that I avoid letting people down. But just ghosting, I end up avoiding the consequences of having to make that decision. It's a defense mechanism im guessing but I'm not sure how to go about addressing it. It's definitely bad because my friends make fun of me for how infrequently I get back to them but making decisions with social impact does actually give me anxiety. Definitely need to see a therapist.",4/14/2019,1
4/16/2019 1:04:46,3,8,8,8,"Wow what a day. Tostones at breakfast, lunch with kliment, got some work in, and finished the day with The Force Awakens. I can't believe that that movie came out almost 4 years ago. It really will book end my college saga. It almost make the start of the new me. Stars wars is the point where everything changed. Kinda cool. Anyway, get some sleep. Gum might not be possible tomorrow but we'll see.",4/15/2019,1
4/16/2019 22:38:35,3,7,6,5,Damn motivation to do school work is mad low right now. I'm getting stuff done at a decent rate but ya know. Also we almost done this semester which is amazing. Almost out of college. Rejoice!,4/16/2019,1
4/19/2019 9:57:55,4,7,7,7,"Not sure why Brian is always so adversarial with my opinions. I'm challenged on everything I say. It's weird but I'm rolling with it. Happened earlier and I thought we worked it out but I don't think I was articulate enough. Saw mukul which was nice. Dude legit just doesn't even consider school anymore haha. I mean he's got a job but like ya know, I guess he's chillin. Weird day but overall shit is winding down. I'm in a really good spot with grades so I gotta just finish well and put in a good effort and I'll be all set.",4/18/2019,1
4/21/2019 17:10:14,3,7,7,6,Pretty decent day. Was high for most of it lmao. Got a good amount done. I'm surprisingly not too stressed for being back. Seems more routine now. Possibly good or bad. Also ate way too much but oh well. We'll see my weight tomorrow. ,4/20/2019,1
4/21/2019 22:07:00,3,7,7,7,Pretty good day. Not bad Easter. Nice seeing the fam. Hace my gifts and headed back. No work done but a lot of organizing done. Hopefully tomorrow I'm able to complete the 411 in the morning.,4/21/2019,1

It might be one of the last times we all get together. Pretty cool I think and grandma would agree. She was very proud of everyone but definitely struggled after Grandpa died. Anyway, super productive Saturday. Prepped well for Sunday where I can basically finish stats and then work on 589.",4/27/2019,1

5/6/2019 18:21:28,3,8,8,8,Chillin honestly. I know most of the stuff for my exams and studying is helping too. The practice I've done is harder than any of the exam questions I've ever had plus I got mad bonus from the previous two midterms. This is for 411 btw. 589 is gonna be weirder but if I put in some more time I should definitely be able to secure a high grade.,5/5/2019,1

It's insanely inspiring that Her set all this up and is taking time off of school to teach. This is what life is all about. I fuck with this so much. I want to give back in this way. Screw normal society and whatnot. People out there just need some assistance and I intend to help out.",5/13/2019,1
5/15/2019 11:48:17,1,8,8,8,HOLY FUCKING SHIT! Today was one of the most amazing days in a while. We biked almost 60 km to and from the waterfall. The way there was pretty damn difficult but the waterfall was worth. Did a backflop? into the water lmao. Bike ride back was fucking awesome. Not so hilly and we rode off into the sunset basically. I was chasing Tou the whole way. We dodged in and out of traffic with not lights! Holy fuck just amazing. The sights and sounds just filled my head with happiness and I lived the moment more than I think I have in a long time. Perhaps since being at the music festival in Prague. Hit the night market for some food and now we gonna pass out. I'm so tired but all the soreness and sunburn is completely worth it.,5/15/2019,1
5/16/2019 11:05:54,2,8,6,8,Walked around the city today. Essentially got a local's perspective on the happenings. Helped with the class. Grading the assignments is pretty fun and the students are just so eager to learn. It's truly inspiring what Her has done here.,5/14/2019,1
5/16/2019 11:14:47,2,8,8,8,Yo almost died during the night. I'm honestly proud of my body for dealing with that. It could have been bad but we pulled thru. Today was great because we got to ride on the motorcycles a lot. Went to a Hmong wedding. Helped with the lesson. Ice-skating a great say.,5/16/2019,1
5/18/2019 8:38:01,2,8,7,8,"Wow. Another amazing day. Didn't expect to go out to lunch with the people we met at Big Brother Mouse but it was delightful. Everyone here is just so amazingly nice. Also, the people we met at Big Bro Mouse were super great and so hype to learn English. Plus they knew Her! Hahaha in addition, they were all high rollers. Like radiologist and studying business and math?! That's so fucking dank. I connect with them on Facebook so I hope to talk again. Chilling on Mount Phousi was a great way to end the trip. So peaceful even with the Farlung. I got so much for so little at the night market. Hopefully peeps like them. I am SO hype for the pants and how I can explore my style in them. Tony is super good at fashion too which is great. Wow, good day.",5/17/2019,1
5/18/2019 8:49:05,2,8,8,8,"So sad we are finally leaving. Amazing how a week here felt like an eternity. I feel so attached to the kids and I want to come back as soon as possible. I was constantly amazed by their spirit and drive. They were so motivated to learn and wonderfully sweet. I hope they liked me. They wanted hugs and everything. I was dead. Almost cried. The food they prepared was better than what must adults in the US can prepare. I wish them all the best, I love them, and I will definitely donate when I'm back in the US. I felt bad I didn't bring anything like Tony but I still want to give. (Thinking of it now, my laptop definitely would have caught on fire so probably for the best haha). Anyway, I think I'm definitely addicted to sex. I had some weird thoughts towards the kids. The vast majority was me wanted to help and support them but yeah there was some weird shit towards the girls. I really think part of it is I have to resocialize myself with girls. I legit just haven't interacted with them in so long and thus have developed a lot of social anxiety around them. It's okay and I want to be gentler with myself but this is going to have to be an active process. I can't just sit on the side anymore and wait. Possibly dating again but also just having more healthy friendships with girls. It's going to be really important to do that in the coming years. We will work on it but it's just that side of my brain that I'm afraid of. I've heard the voice before and thus I recognized it. I've just been passively feeding it and it grew too powerful. It's time to change that. I will spend lots of effort to change this. Good luck my bro! Remember be understanding with yourself, but be determined to change.",5/18/2019,1

The timezones are gonna be fucked af because we're still in Hong Kong right now but we technically land in 4 hours in Newark even tho 16 hours will have passed for us. Also, fuck these airports for putting everything in arrivals and not in departures. We missed the sleep pods at Hanoi and the showers in Hong Kong. Also, it should not be sooooo fucking hard to find baby wipes. Don't parents need those?! Like how do no stores have them? Anyway, snagged an avid rental to take for Newark to Manchester. Hopefully we'll be awake enough to make the drive lmao. ",5/19/2019,1

I finally organized all the stuff I've saved over my trips and college. Feels good to have stuff where it should be. Almost done tearing down from last semester. Just gotta get the Asana data off and then I can start putting new courses up. Got the stage mix gen working on the big laptop so I can start experimenting again. Next priority is to finish the 305 assignment and then add text to the stress correlation blog post. I honestly might just put a brief summary and let the charts speek for themselves because sometimes the text seems redundant. Anyway, heading to RI tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have time in the evenings to work on things.",5/21/2019,1

Progress is being made but I think I might have just finally convinced dad to take out loans and just make the shit happen. It feels like he's been talking about getting this place going  since forever so that would be the step to just get it done once and for all. Even he said his deadline has to be this summer so I think it can be done. Really, the uncertainty here comes from Maria and where she will be. Oh well, I think that's better now but I hope the family stabilizes so we can really get this done. Holy shit tho, fuck 305 already. I should've done the shit yesterday so it's mostly.my fault but we won't mention that lmao",5/22/2019,1
